# Optimal Tube Station Locations with Linear Programming: The Bakerloo Line Extension Case Study

This repository contains the data and code for a research project that explores the use of linear programming to determine optimal station locations for the Bakerloo Line Extension in South London.

# Key findings:

An adapted P-Median Problem formulation yielded a more workable solution than a classic Location Set Covering Problem formulation in terms of minimizing walking time to stations.
The model recommends a total of 6 new Tube stations for the BLE, instead of the 4 stations in the current proposal.
The model can be further generalized for use in future station location planning research.
